Every pale green scoop of this herbal ice cream captures the sweetness of baby peas from Rancho La Familia in Santa Maria and fresh mint from Kenter Canyon Farms. We love Rancho La Familia because they have created a truly community farm in every sense of the word, honoring the organic crops they grow, their neighbors, their farmers market family, and even the beneficial bugs on their land. Kenter Canyon Farms is legendary in the food and farming worlds: they introduced America to spring lettuce mix (mesclun) by growing it first for legendary chef Alice Waters at Chez Panisse!",
